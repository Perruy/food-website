                    <ol class="instructions">
                      <!-- List instructions here -->
                      <li>Use a paper towel to pat dry the chicken completely dry. Cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes.</li>
                      <li>Transfer cubed chicken to a mixing bowl, along with 1 tablespoon oil, salt, and cornstarch. Stir well to coat evenly.</li>
                      <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the hot oil sizzles, about 1 minute. Add chicken and sauté until golden brown on all sides, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer the cooked chicken onto a plate.</li>

                <h2 class="recipe-title">Recipe Name:PASTA WITH PEAS</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <P>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling, 1 small onion, diced, 1 Ib (450 grams) peas, fresh or frozen, 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water, plus more if needed,½ lb (220 grams Short shaped pasta (shells, elbows, ditaloni…),½ cup (50 grams) grated parmesan cheese, plus more to serve and salt & pepper, to taste </P>
                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol class="instructions">
                  <!-- List instructions here -->
                  <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until it has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Add the peas and broth, raise the heat, bring to a boil, and stir in pasta and salt (I use 1 tsp of salt, and then I adjust the seasoning at the end).</li>
                  <li>Reduce the heat, bring to a simmer, cover with a lid, and cook your pasta in the starchy water. During the cooking time, stir often until the water is absorbed; otherwise, it will stick to the bottom. The water should barely cover the pasta, but that's fine; add extra water gradually only if needed.
                </li>
                  <li>Cook until the pasta is done but firm to the bite. The remaining liquid should be minimal at this point. Turn off the heat and stir in freshly grated parmesan cheese until melted and combined with the pasta and peas. Taste and adjust the seasoning if desired.</li>
                  <li>Serve immediately with a drizzle of olive oil, black pepper, and extra parmesan cheese if you like. Enjoy!</li>
